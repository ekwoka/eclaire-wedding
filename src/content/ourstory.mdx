## Our Love Story

_In a bar in Hapjeong, on a Friday night just before Halloween, 2017, a boy with hot pink hair who doesn't even drink alcohol was sitting at a table, in costume of course. A girl entered, dragged along by her friend, neither of them realizing it was a halloween party._

_The boy asked the girl to sit next to him. Her friend warned her to stay away. Not being one to accept advice from others, she sat down. They talked of sky lanterns, fungi, and Rapunzel._

_Through thousands of miles travelled together, moving from Seoul, to Singapore, to Dubai, they were together._

_6 years later, on the coast of the Black Sea, he knelt down on one knee. Without a word, she reached out her hand and accepted the ring on her finger._
