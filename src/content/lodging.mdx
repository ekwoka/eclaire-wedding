## Where to Stay

Seoul is a large city with plenty of great choices to stay.

### Myeongdong

If you wish to stay nearer to the wedding venue, then the Myeongdong area would be a great choice. It is a popular shopping district with many hotels and restaurants. It is just a short walk away from the palaces.

We recommend:

**[Aloft Seoul Myeongdong](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/selmo-aloft-seoul-myeongdong/overview/)**: \~â‚©245,000 KRW per night (\~$185 USD)

### Hongdae/Sinchon

For a more youthful vibe, you can stay in the Hongdae/Sinchon area. It is a popular area for young people with cafes, bars, and clubs. It is nestled near 5 universities, so there is plenty of affordable eating and fun. We spent a lot of time here (this is the area where we met!).

We recommend:

**[Ryse, Autograph Collection](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/selsa-ryse-autograph-collection/overview/)**: \~284,000 KRW per night (\~$215 USD)

There's also plenty of guesthouses and cheaper hotels in the area. A night can easily be under $50 USD.
