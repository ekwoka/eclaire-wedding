### Youngster's place- Hongdae/Shinchon

All the unique cafes, restaurants, and shops

- middle of all the fun things and want to walk into the bustle area -> Hongdae
- want to be near all the cafes but prefer little quiet place -> Yeonnam

For a more youthful vibe, you can stay in the Hongdae/Sinchon area. It is a popular area for young people with cafes, bars, and clubs. It is nestled near 5 universities, so there is plenty of affordable eating and fun. We spent a lot of time here (this is the area where we met!).

recommend hotels at station:

**[Ryse, Autograph Collection](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/selsa-ryse-autograph-collection/overview/)**: \~284,000 KRW per night (\~$215 USD)

There's also plenty of guesthouses and cheaper hotels in the area. A night can easily be under $50 USD.
